# Analyzing-Sentiment-on-Twitter
Abstract—This paper aims to deliver a thorough, step-by-step
explanation of the sentiment analysis process applied to Twitter
data using machine learning methods. The project constructs a
classification pipeline to assess tweet sentiment as either positive
(1) or negative (0), evaluating the model on unseen dataset that
lacks sentiment labels while prioritizing accurate classification
based on textual content and features. A Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP) classifier is employed, optimized through GridSearchCV
for effective hyperparameter tuning. Key preprocessing steps
include converting text to lowercase, removing URLs and
punctuation, tokenizing, lemmatizing, and applying TF-IDF
vectorization. The model’s performance is measured using
the F1 macro score, achieving a score of 7.645 on the DSLE
platform, which secured a position on the leaderboard and
underscored the effectiveness of our approach in improving
sentiment classification accuracy.
